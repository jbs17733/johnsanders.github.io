<h3>The Beginning of the Journey</h3>
	<p>At the beginning of the summer, myself and 3 other friends set off on the adventure of a lifetime. We had plans to move to Big Bear Lake, CA (a small mountain town East of LA) and find jobs to sustain us for the summer. We had rent paid for the entire summer and everything was ready to go. We embarked on our journey on May 28th, drove to the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas to camp for the night, then all the way to Denver to catch a My Morning Jacket show at Red Rocks Amphitheater. We then drove from Denver down through Southern Utah, Arizona and Nevada all the way to Big Bear Lake, stopping to camp in Zion National Park in Utah. After arriving in Big Bear and getting settled in, we quickly found out that the job market was basically non-existant, so we had to make some moves. We ended up having a buddy in Jackson Hole, WY who had some job openings for us, so we packed up the truck with all of our belongings and trecked all the way up to the most epic town in the United States of America, Jackson Hole.</p>

	<h3>The Vibes</h3>
	<p>The vibes in Jackson Hole, or just Jackson, as the locals refer to their unparalleled adventure mecca, are like nothing else. If you've ever been to a kicked back, relaxed, "everthing's cool no worries" kind of place, just think of Jackson as the combination of that with the most rugged, raw, undeniable environment you can think of. It is the definition of <b>wild</b> in every sense of the word.  Everyday, whether working at Leisure Sports, or exploring the incredible landscape, Jackson never ceased to impress me.</p>
